- **Workflow System**: Pre-configured six-stage workflow, Feat workflow, BMad agile, Spec extension, and Git smart commands.
- **Integration Ecosystem**: Covers CCR, CCometixLine, Context7, Open Web Search, DeepWiki, Playwright, Serena, etc.
- **Command Line Tools**: Provides `ccjk init/update/ccr/ccu/uninstall/config-switch` commands and aggregates them in an interactive menu.
