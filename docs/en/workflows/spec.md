## Workflow Stages

Spec Workflow typically includes the following stages:

1. **Requirements Collection** → Collect and analyze functional requirements
2. **Requirements Validation** → Validate requirements completeness and feasibility
3. **Solution Design** → Design technical solutions and architecture
4. **Task Breakdown** → Break down requirements into executable tasks
5. **Implementation Development** → Develop according to tasks
6. **Test Validation** → Write and execute test cases
7. **Document Updates** → Update related documents
8. **Review Acceptance** → Conduct code review and feature acceptance

## Usage Examples

### Complete Workflow Example

Suppose you want to develop a "user comment" feature:

**Step 1: Requirements Analysis**
```
Please use Spec Workflow to analyze requirements for user comment feature
```

**Step 2: Design Phase**
```
Based on the requirements just discussed, please design the technical solution for comment feature, including data model and API interfaces
```

**Step 3: Task Breakdown**
```
Break down the comment feature into specific development tasks and list task dependencies
```

**Step 4: Implementation Development**
```
Please start implementing the first task of comment feature according to the task list
```

### Combine with CCJK Workflows

Spec Workflow can be combined with other CCJK workflows:

```bash
# In Claude Code
/ccjk:workflow Develop user comment feature, use Spec Workflow for requirements analysis

# Or use feature development workflow
/ccjk:feat User comment feature
```

In Codex, although Spec Workflow can be used as MCP service, there's no corresponding `/prompts:` command, need to use directly in conversation.

## Best Practices

### Use Early in Project

Use Spec Workflow early in project to lock requirements scope:

- ✅ **Reduce Rework**: Avoid late requirement changes through structured requirements analysis
- ✅ **Clear Goals**: Clear requirements documents help team understand project goals
- ✅ **Risk Identification**: Identify technical risks and implementation difficulties early

### Team Collaboration

In team environments:

- **Unified Templates**: Use unified requirements and design templates
- **Regular Reviews**: Regularly conduct requirements reviews and design reviews
- **Document Sync**: Maintain consistency between code, documents, and requirements

### Custom Templates

Combine with `advanced/templates.md` to customize Spec templates to fit team standards:

```bash
# View template configuration
cat ~/.claude/templates/spec-requirements.md

# Customize template
# Edit template file to comply with team standards
```

### Version Control

It's recommended to include Spec Workflow generated documents in version control:

```bash
# Create workflow document directory
mkdir -p .spec-workflow/{requirements,design,tasks}

# Save generated documents to corresponding directories
# Include in Git version control
git add .spec-workflow/
git commit -m "docs: add spec workflow documents"
```

## Integration with Other Tools

### Context7 Integration

Combine with Context7 MCP service to get library documentation:

```
Please query the latest documentation for React Hook Form for form validation in comment feature
```

### DeepWiki Integration

Use DeepWiki to get project background information:

```
Please query the project architecture documentation to understand modules that comment feature needs to integrate with
```

### Git Workflow Integration

Combine with CCJK Git workflow to automatically generate commit messages:

```bash
# After completing requirements analysis
/git-commit -m "docs: add comment feature requirements spec"
```

## Troubleshooting

### MCP Service Not Started

If Spec Workflow cannot be used:

1. **Check MCP Configuration**: Confirm `settings.json` or `config.toml` contains Spec Workflow configuration
2. **Check Service Status**: Confirm MCP service is running normally
3. **Restart Application**: Restart Claude Code or Codex to load new configuration

### Dashboard Cannot Be Accessed

If dashboard cannot start:

```bash
# Check port occupancy
lsof -i :3000  # or other port

# Manually specify port
npx -y @pimzino/spec-workflow-mcp@latest --dashboard --port 3001
```

### Document Generation Failed

If document generation fails:

1. **Check Permissions**: Ensure write permissions for working directory
2. **Check Disk Space**: Ensure sufficient disk space
3. **View Logs**: Check MCP service logs for detailed error information
