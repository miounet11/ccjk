## Intelligent Context Detection

I automatically detect your context and suggest relevant actions:

| Context | Detection | Suggestion |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Uncommitted changes | `git status` shows changes | "Ready to commit? Type **1**" |
| New feature request | User mentions "feature/add/create" | "Let me help plan this. Type **4**" |
| Bug report | User mentions "bug/error/fix" | "Let's debug systematically. Type **5**" |
| Code review needed | User mentions "review/check" | "I'll do a deep review. Type **2**" |
| Writing tests | User mentions "test/tdd" | "Starting TDD workflow. Type **3**" |

## How It Works

### Step 1: Start Conversation
Just say what you want to do, or type a number for quick action.

### Step 2: Smart Detection
I'll analyze your request and suggest the best approach.

### Step 3: One-Click Execution
Confirm with a number or "yes" and I'll handle everything.

### Step 4: Guided Process
I'll guide you through each step with clear checkpoints.
